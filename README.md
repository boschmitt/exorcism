# exorcism

exorcism iteratively apply the distance-k ExorLink cube transformation
to cube pairs. If replacement of the starting cubes by the resulting cubes leads
to simplification, the cover is modified without changing the function
represented by it.

This implementation is based on [4].

## Limitations
* Maximum of 32 inputs.
* Single output.

## Input
The input must be an ASCII file in standard PLA format, representing a
single-output Boolean function. In the current version, the donâ€™t-cares of the
input function are ignored and only the on-set of the function is considered.

## TODO
* Implement pair queue as circular buffers.
* Implement exorlink-4 operation.
* Add support for multiple outputs.
